    "### What is a `classmethod` in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `classmethod` is a special type of method that is bound to the class, rather than an instance of the class. It can access and modify class-level attributes and properties. It’s defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and takes the **class** itself (`cls`) as its first parameter, rather than the instance (`self`), which is used in regular instance methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Bound to the Class**: A class method is not bound to an instance of the class, but to the class itself.\n",
    "2. **Access to Class Attributes**: It can modify or access class-level attributes or properties but cannot directly modify instance-specific attributes unless explicitly passed.\n",
    "3. **Can be Called on the Class Itself**: Class methods can be called on the class itself (without creating an instance), and are commonly used for factory methods or methods that modify class-level state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def my_class_method(cls, parameters):\n",
    "        # Logic that operates on the class level (using `cls`)\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `cls` refers to the class `MyClass` itself (like `self` refers to the instance in regular methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Basic Usage of `classmethod`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canine\"  # Class-level attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name    # Instance-level attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age      # Instance-level attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_species(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.species\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the class method without creating an instance\n",
    "print(Dog.get_species())  # Output: Canine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class-level variable**: `species` is a class-level variable, shared across all instances of the `Dog` class.\n",
    "2. **`get_species(cls)`**: This is a class method. It takes `cls` as its first argument (representing the `Dog` class itself). It can access the class variable `species`, but not instance-level variables like `name` or `age`, unless explicitly passed.\n",
    "3. **Calling the class method**: You can call the class method directly on the class, without needing to create an instance of the class (`Dog.get_species()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `classmethod`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factory Methods**: Class methods are often used for **factory methods**—methods that return an instance of the class, possibly with some customized setup.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  class Person:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "          self.name = name\n",
    "          self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "      @classmethod\n",
    "      def from_birth_year(cls, name, birth_year):\n",
    "          age = 2023 - birth_year\n",
    "          return cls(name, age)\n",
    "\n",
    "  person = Person.from_birth_year(\"Alice\", 1990)\n",
    "  print(person.name, person.age)  # Output: Alice 33\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing or Modifying Class State**: Class methods are used when you need to modify or access class-level attributes or when the method needs to apply to the class as a whole, rather than a specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Constructors**: Class methods can also serve as **alternative constructors**, providing flexibility for object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Modifying Class-Level State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Account:\n",
    "    interest_rate = 0.05  # Class-level attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def set_interest_rate(cls, rate):\n",
    "        cls.interest_rate = rate  # Modify the class-level attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_interest(self):\n",
    "        return self.balance * Account.interest_rate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before changing interest rate\n",
    "acc1 = Account(1000)\n",
    "print(acc1.calculate_interest())  # Output: 50.0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing interest rate using class method\n",
    "Account.set_interest_rate(0.07)\n",
    "\n",
    "# After changing interest rate\n",
    "print(acc1.calculate_interest())  # Output: 70.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Class-level attribute**: `interest_rate` is a class-level attribute, which is shared across all instances of `Account`.\n",
    "- **Class method `set_interest_rate`**: The class method allows you to modify the class-level attribute (`interest_rate`).\n",
    "- **Accessing the modified class attribute**: After calling the class method to change the interest rate, all instances of `Account` will reflect the new value for `interest_rate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`classmethod`** is a method bound to the class rather than an instance.\n",
    "- It takes the class itself as the first argument (`cls`), which allows it to access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
    "- **Use cases**: It is ideal for factory methods, modifying class-level state, or providing alternative constructors.\n"

    "### What is a `staticmethod` in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `staticmethod` is a method that is bound to the **class** rather than an instance of the class. Unlike instance methods, static methods do not take a `self` or `cls` parameter. They do not have access to instance-specific data (attributes or methods), and they cannot modify the class state or instance state. Static methods are used for utility functions that perform operations but do not need to modify the class or instance state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No access to `self` or `cls`**: A static method does not have access to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) unless they are explicitly passed.\n",
    "2. **Defined using `@staticmethod` decorator**: Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",

    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def add(x, y):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Returns the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n",

    "print(MathOperations.multiply(5, 3))  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Methods (`add`, `multiply`)**: These methods don't need access to any instance-specific data (`self`) or class-specific data (`cls`). They simply perform operations on the parameters passed to them.\n",
    "- **Calling Static Methods**: You can call these static methods directly on the class (`MathOperations.add(5, 3)`) without needing to instantiate an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for Static Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utility Functions**: When you want to create helper functions that do not need to access or modify class or instance attributes. For example, mathematical functions or string manipulation methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Code Organization**: Static methods are a good choice for logically grouping utility functions inside a class, even though the methods themselves don't require access to instance or class data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: Static methods can be used for tasks such as converting data from one format to another, where the method doesn't need to modify any class or instance state.\n",
