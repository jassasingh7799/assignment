    "question 2- Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "In Python, identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowed Characters: Identifiers can include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Sensitivity: Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE are considered different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length: There is no explicit limit to the length of an identifier, but it's best practice to keep them reasonably short while still meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserved Words: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python's reserved keywords (like if, else, while, def, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming Conventions: While not strictly enforced, it’s common practice to use lowercase letters for variable names, and to use CamelCase for class names\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "    my_variable\n",
    "    var123\n",
    "    myFunction\n",
    "    _myName"

    "Question- What are comments in Python, and why are they useful? Provide an example.\n",
    "Answer- In Python, comments are text annotations in the code that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to explain code, provide context, or make notes for future reference. Comments are useful for enhancing code readability and maintainability, especially in collaborative projects or complex codebases\n",

    "question- Why is proper indentation important in Python?\n",

    "1. IndentationError: This error occurs if the code isn't lined up properly. For example, if a block of code is not indented when it should be, Python will show an error message.\n",

    "2. SyntaxError: Sometimes, if the indentation is mixed up, it can lead to a syntax error, meaning the code can’t be understood by Python.\n",

    "Question- Differentiate between expression and statement in Python with examples.\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "In Python, expressions and statements are two fundamental concepts that serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. Expressions can consist of variables, operators, and function calls. The key point is that they always produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Expression:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = 3 + 5  # This expression evaluates to 8\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String Expression:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   greeting = \"Hello, \" + \"World!\"  # This evaluates to \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Function Call Expression:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   length = len(\"Python\")  # The expression evaluates to 6\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action. Statements do not return a value; instead, they may change the state of the program, create variables, or control the flow of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Statement:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 10  # This assigns the value 10 to the variable x\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conditional Statement:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if x > 5:\n",
    "       print(\"x is greater than 5\")  # This is a statement that prints text if the condition is true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Loop Statement:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(3):\n",
    "       print(i)  # This is a statement that executes a block of code multiple times\n",
    "   ```"
