    "Answer- \n",
    "Organize Code: Functions help you break your code into smaller, easier-to-understand pieces. Each function does one specific job, making your overall program simpler to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuse Code: Once you write a function, you can use it as many times as you want without rewriting it. This saves time and helps avoid mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hide Complexity: Functions let you keep complicated details hidden. You can use a function without knowing exactly how it works, which makes your code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easier to Test: You can test functions one at a time to see if they work correctly. This makes it easier to find and fix problems in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Inputs: Functions can take different inputs (called parameters). This means you can use the same function with different data, making it more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Build Bigger Programs: Functions allow you to build larger programs step by step. You can write a function for one part, test it, and then move on to the next part."

    "#27) what is encapsulation in oops?\n",
    "Ans-In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is a fundamental concept that refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit or class. Additionally, encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation means:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bundling data and methods together: A class in OOP holds both the data (attributes or properties) and the functions (methods) that operate on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hiding the internal state (data hiding): The internal state of an object is often hidden from the outside world by making the attributes private or protected, and only accessible through specific public methods (often called getters and setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Control access to the data: By controlling how the data is accessed and modified, encapsulation can enforce rules about what values can be assigned to the data, thereby maintaining the integrity of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private vs. Public: The internal data (attributes) of an object can be marked as private or protected, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, the object provides public methods to interact with that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and Setter Methods: These are public methods that allow controlled access to private variables. A getter method retrieves the value of an attribute, and a setter method modifies the value of an attribute, often with additional validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Encapsulation:\n",
    "Data Hiding: It helps protect an object's state by hiding the internal data and requiring controlled access through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: The internal workings of an object are encapsulated, meaning you can change the implementation without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Maintenance: By restricting direct access to data, encapsulation allows for easier debugging and maintenance of code. You can change the way data is stored internally without changing how it’s accessed by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Reusability: Encapsulation allows the creation of more flexible and reusable code by isolating the internal details and exposing only the necessary interface."

    "#28) Explain the use of access modifiers in Python classes?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class attributes and methods. They help define whether certain parts of a class (such as attributes and methods) can be accessed from outside the class or not. While Python does not have explicit access modifiers like some other languages.e.g., public, private, protected like java and c++ it uses a system of naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main levels of access control in Python are:\n",
    "1) Public Access\n",
    "2) Protected Access\n",
    "3) Private Access\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Public Access-\n",
    "    1) Attributes/Methods: Any attribute or method in a Python class is public, meaning it can be accessed and modified directly from outside the class.\n",
    "    2)Syntax: Public members are simply declared without any leading underscores(make)\n",
    "    example of public-\n",
    "        class Car:\n",
    "            def __init__(self,make,model):\n",
    "                self.make=make\n",
    "                self.model=model\n",
    "    3)Public access means that anyone who uses the class can access these attributes and methods directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Private Access:\n",
    "    1) Attributes/Methods: To make an attribute or method private, Python uses double underscores (__) as a naming convention. This triggers name mangling, which makes the attribute or method name harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "    2) Syntax: __make\n",
    "    example of private-\n",
    "        class Car:\n",
    "            def __init__(self,make,car)\n",
    "                self.__make=make\n",
    "                self.__car=car\n",
    "    3) Private access makes it harder (but not impossible) to access or modify the attribute or method directly from outside the class. The __ prefix triggers name mangling, which internally changes the name of the attribute (e.g., self.__balance becomes self._BankAccount__balance), making it less likely to be accessed inadvertently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Protected Access:\n",
    "    1) Attributes/Methods: A convention in Python to indicate that an attribute or method is protected is by prefixing it with a single underscore (_). This is a hint to other programmers that these members are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses, but it does not prevent access.\n",
    "    2) Syntax: _attribute_name\n",
    "    example of protected-\n",
    "        class Car:\n",
    "            def __init__(self,make,car):\n",
    "                self._make=make\n",
    "                self._car=car\n",
    "    3) Protected access is essentially a convention in Python. It tells developers that they should treat the attribute as protected (meaning it’s intended for use within the class or subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following why we use access specifier-\n",
    "Encapsulation: Helps in encapsulating the data and restricting direct access, providing more control over how the data is accessed or modified. This is a key principle of Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Intentions: Using access modifiers communicates to other developers how the class members should be used, even if Python doesn’t strictly enforce them. For instance, _attribute signals that a member is protected, while __attribute signals that it should be treated as private.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Safety: By restricting access to certain parts of the code, you can prevent unintended side effects, reduce the risk of bugs, and ensure that the internal state of an object is only modified in a controlled manner."

    "#29) What is inheritance in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where one class (the subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., fields and methods) from another class (the superclass or base class). It allows the creation of a new class based on an existing class, promoting code reuse and establishing a natural hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of Inheritance:\n",
    "1) Base Class (Parent Class or Superclass):\n",
    "The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.\n",
    "It defines common attributes and behaviors that can be shared with other classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) Derived Class (Child Class or Subclass):\n",
    "The class that inherits properties and behaviors from the base class.\n",
    "It can also have additional properties and methods that are specific to it, or it can override the inherited methods to change or extend functionality.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Access to Inherited Members:\n",
    "The subclass inherits both instance variables and methods from the base class.\n",
    "It can access the inherited members directly unless they are marked with an access modifier (like private) that restricts access.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Overriding:\n",
    "A subclass can override methods from the superclass to provide its own implementation. This is done by defining a method in the subclass with the same name and signature as in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Method overloading:\n",
    "Method overloading in Python refers to defining a method with the same name but different argument types or counts. Python does not support traditional method overloading like in other languages.

    "#31) Explain method overriding in Python?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Method overriding in Python is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is part of runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism), where the method of the subclass overrides the method in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method in a superclass is overridden in a subclass, the subclass's version of the method is called, even if the object is of the superclass type. This allows subclasses to modify or extend the behavior of methods inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points of Method Overriding:\n",
    "The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.\n",
    "When the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the subclass’s method is invoked (even if the reference is of the superclass type).\n",
    "The super() function can be used to call the superclass's version of the method if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason fro using method overriding-\n",
    "Customization: Method overriding allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of a method inherited from the superclass, customizing it to fit the subclass's needs.\n",

    "#37) What is abstraction in Python? How is it implemented ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in Python refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities to the user. The goal is to provide a simplified interface, while keeping the internal workings of a system hidden. This helps in reducing complexity and improving the maintainability of the code.\n",
    "abstraction is commonly implemented using abstract classes and abstract methods, which are part of the abc (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "Abstract Class: This is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be inherited by other classes. It may contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class.\n",
    "Abstract Method: These are methods that are declared in an abstract class, but do not have any implementation. Any class that inherits from the abstract class is required to provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason of why to use Abstraction:\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: Abstraction allows you to separate the \"what\" from the \"how.\" For example, you can define the concept of \"Shape\" and leave the specific details (like how to calculate the area) to the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability and Maintenance: When the interface remains consistent, you can reuse the same code while updating the underlying implementation without affecting other parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Abstraction helps in encapsulating implementation details, preventing users from needing to understand complex code, which makes the system easier to maintain and extend."

    "#38)  Explain the importance of abstraction in object-oriented programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the core principles it plays a crucial role in designing and structuring software systems in a way that simplifies complexity, promotes maintainability, and enhances code reusability. Below are some key reasons why abstraction is important in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Simplifies Complex Systems\n",
    "   Abstraction allows you to hide the implementation details and expose only the relevant functionality to the user. This simplifies the interaction with objects or classes, making it easier for developers to understand and use them without needing to know all the underlying details.\n",
    "   For example, when you interact with a car object, you don't need to know how the engine works internally or how the fuel is processed. You only need to know how to use the car—press the accelerator, brake, steer, etc. This makes the system more approachable and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Improves Maintainability\n",
    "   By abstracting the details of a class implementation, the code becomes more flexible to change. If the implementation of an abstracted component changes (e.g., a new algorithm or technology is introduced), you only need to update the internal details of the class or method. The external interface (the abstracted interface) remains the same, so the rest of the system doesn't need to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: If a class that calculates tax changes the way it calculates taxes internally, as long as the interface (method signature) remains the same, the rest of the system will continue to work as expected, without requiring any changes in the other classes that use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). Encourages Modularity\n",
    "   Abstraction allows developers to focus on high-level design by breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable pieces. Each component or class can be developed independently with well-defined interfaces, allowing multiple developers to work on different parts of a system simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Consider a large-scale project like an e-commerce application. The payment processing system can be abstracted into a `PaymentProcessor` interface, and different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.) can implement the same interface in different classes. Developers can then work on payment-related features independently of other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4). Promotes Code Reusability\n",
    "   Abstraction allows you to write more general and reusable code. By defining abstract classes or interfaces, you can create components that can be reused in different contexts with minimal changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: An abstract class `Shape` can define methods like `area()` and `perimeter()`. Concrete classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` can implement these methods in their own way. This way, the `Shape` class acts as a general template, and you can reuse the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods for all shapes without repeating the same code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5). Improves Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
    "   Abstraction allows you to design flexible systems that can evolve over time. Because abstract classes and interfaces define common behavior that can be implemented in different ways, you can easily extend the system by adding new components without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: If you add a new `Square` class or `Triangle` class to a drawing application, as long as they follow the same abstract interface (like `Shape`), you can extend the application to support these new shapes without changing the code that already handles circles and rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6). Reduces Coupling and Increases Cohesion\n",
    "   Abstraction helps in reducing the coupling between different components of a system. With well-defined abstractions, classes and modules can interact through interfaces or abstract classes rather than through concrete implementations. This reduces dependencies between components, making the system more modular and less prone to bugs when changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Coupling refers to how closely two components or classes are related to each other.\n",
    "   - Cohesion refers to how closely the methods and attributes of a class or component are related to its intended functionality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In well-abstracted systems, you can change or replace a class's implementation without affecting other classes that rely on the abstraction. For instance, a class that interacts with a database can be abstracted so that you can swap out one database implementation for another without changing the rest of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "7). Enforces Consistency and Predictability\n",
    "   Abstraction establishes a clear and consistent interface for objects, meaning that each class exposes a known set of methods and properties. This consistency makes it easier for developers to interact with objects, as they know what to expect from them, leading to more predictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: If you create an interface `Drawable` with a method `draw()`, any object that implements `Drawable` can be used interchangeably in contexts that require drawing, regardless of whether it's a circle, square, or polygon. As long as the object implements `draw()`, the system can interact with it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "8). Helps in Managing Complexity\n",
    "   In large applications, systems can quickly become complex. Abstraction helps manage this complexity by allowing developers to define higher-level concepts and interactions without worrying about every low-level detail. This results in a cleaner, more organized codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A banking system can abstract the concept of accounts into a `BankAccount` class with abstract methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. Different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking, loan) can implement the same interface, making it easier to manage a wide range of account types with consistent methods.\n",

    "#39) How are abstract methods different from regular methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Definition and Purpose\n",
    "   - Abstract Methods:\n",
    "     - Purpose: Abstract methods are used to define an interface for a class. They declare a method that must be implemented by subclasses, but they do not provide any implementation in the abstract class itself.\n",
    "     - Definition: An abstract method is defined in an abstract class using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. The method has no body in the abstract class, and it serves as a contract for subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "     - Key Point: You cannot instantiate a class with abstract methods until all abstract methods are implemented in a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Regular Methods:\n",
    "     - Purpose: Regular methods, on the other hand, provide both a method signature (the function name and arguments) and a body (the code that runs when the method is called).\n",
    "     - Definition: Regular methods can be defined inside any class (abstract or not) and provide the actual implementation of the behavior.\n",
    "     - Key Point: Regular methods can be called directly (on instances of the class) if the class is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implementation\n",
    "   - Abstract Methods:\n",
    "     - They do not have an implementation in the abstract class. They only have the signature (name and arguments).\n",
    "     - Any subclass that inherits from the abstract class must implement these abstract methods in order to be instantiated.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Regular Methods:\n",
    "     - They have an implementation in the class where they are defined. A regular method contains the actual code that is executed when the method is called.\n",
    "     - Subclasses can inherit regular methods as-is, or they can override them with a different implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance\n",
    "   - Abstract Methods:\n",
    "     - Abstract methods serve as a blueprint for subclasses. A subclass that inherits from an abstract class must implement all abstract methods to avoid a `TypeError` (you can't instantiate a class with unimplemented abstract methods).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Regular Methods:\n",
    "     - Regular methods are inherited by subclasses, but they do not require subclasses to override them. If a subclass does not provide its own implementation, the subclass will inherit the regular method as it is from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Instantiation\n",
    "   - Abstract Methods:\n",
    "     - You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly. The class is meant to be subclassed, and the abstract methods in the class must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Regular Methods:\n",
    "     - A class with regular methods can be instantiated as usual. You can create an object of the class, and call its regular methods directly on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Syntax\n",

    "**Enforcing Interface Implementation\n",

    "  \n",
    "- Polymorphism: With interfaces, we can work with different classes through the same common interface. For example, the `Shape` interface allows you to treat `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` objects uniformly, despite them having different internal implementations.\n",

    "Modular Design: Interfaces promote modularity in design. You can create reusable components that adhere to the same interface and swap them easily. For example, you can replace the `Circle` class with another shape class, such as `Triangle`, as long as it implements the `Shape` interface.\n",

    "In Python, polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to provide their own implementation of a method that is defined in a common interface (or base class). Method overriding is a key mechanism through which polymorphism is achieved. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",

    "#45) How does polymorphism improve code readability and reusability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that improves both code readability and reusability in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Code Readability\n",
    "   - Abstraction of Complexity: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface. This means you can write code that can work with multiple types of objects, without having to know their exact class or type. This simplifies the logic of your code and makes it easier to understand.\n",
    "     - Example: Consider a method that accepts a `Shape` interface. The method can work with various shape types like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Triangle`, but the client code does not need to know the details of each shape’s implementation. It just calls a method like `draw()`, and the correct method is invoked based on the objects actual type.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Less Boilerplate Code: Polymorphism eliminates the need for repetitive conditional statements (like `if` or `switch`), which would otherwise be required to differentiate between different object types. This makes the code less cluttered and easier to maintain.\n",
    "     - Example: Without polymorphism, you might have to check the type of each object (`if (shape instanceof Circle) {...}`), but polymorphism allows you to directly call the `draw()` method on `shape`, regardless of whether its a `Circle`, `Rectangle`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Code Reusability\n",
    "   - Single Interface for Multiple Implementations: With polymorphism, you can create a general method or class that works for many different object types. This makes it easier to extend your program with new types of objects without modifying existing code. You can simply introduce a new subclass or implementation of an existing interface.\n",
    "     - Example: If you have a method that processes various types of payment methods (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`, `BankTransfer`), polymorphism allows you to define a single method (`processPayment()`) that can be reused across all payment types. New payment methods can be added without changing the existing processing logic.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Increased Flexibility and Maintainability: As your codebase grows, polymorphism makes it easier to extend functionality without touching existing code, reducing the risk of bugs and making future modifications easier. This allows developers to follow the Open/Closed Principle (i.e., open for extension, closed for modification).\n",
    "     - Example: A `PaymentProcessor` class that supports multiple payment methods might be easily extended to support new types of payments, like `ApplePay` or `GooglePay`, simply by adding new subclasses that implement the `PaymentMethod` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Real-World Analogy for Clarity\n",
    "   Think of polymorphism like a universal remote control. The remote works with different brands of televisions, but you don’t need to know the specific model of each TV to change the channel or adjust the volume. Similarly, in programming, polymorphism allows you to interact with different objects through a common interface without worrying about the details of each specific object.\n",

    "#46) Describe how Python supports polymorphism with duck typing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Python supports polymorphism through a concept known as **duck typing**, which is a more informal or flexible approach to type compatibility than traditional polymorphism in statically typed languages. Duck typing is based on the idea that if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck, meaning Python cares more about an objects behavior (i.e., what methods it can perform) than its actual type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism works through duck typing by allowing objects to be treated in a consistent way as long as they support the necessary methods or behaviors. This approach relies on the idea that you do not need to know the exact type of an object, as long as it has the required properties or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1). No Explicit Inheritance or Interfaces\n",
    "   Unlike statically typed languages, Python does not require a class to explicitly inherit from a base class or implement an interface to support polymorphism. Instead, polymorphism is achieved by relying on whether the object has the required methods or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Behavior Over Type\n",
    "   The key principle is that if an object acts like a particular type, it can be treated as that type, regardless of its actual class. In other words, polymorphism in Python is not about the type of the object, but about its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example of Duck Typing\n",

    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Duck Typing and Polymorphism in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity and Flexibility: Duck typing allows for simpler and more flexible code. You don’t need to design complex class hierarchies or interfaces to achieve polymorphism. If an object can perform the required behavior, it can be used in place of another.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Loose Coupling: Duck typing decouples components. You do not have to worry about what type an object is, only whether it can do what is needed (exmple if it has the necessary methods or attributes).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extensibility: Duck typing makes it easy to introduce new classes or objects that can work in the same way as existing ones. As long as the new class implements the required methods, it can be used without changes to the existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Concise Code: You don’t need to explicitly define or check types; you can directly use objects in functions that expect specific behavior.\n",

    "#47) How do you achieve encapsulation in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of restricting access to certain details or implementation of an object, while exposing only the necessary functionality to the outside world. It is one of the four core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), alongside inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation helps in protecting the internal state of an object and controlling how the data is accessed and modified, which makes your code more maintainable, secure, and modular. \n",
    "\n",
    "-Achieving Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1). Public Attributes and Methods\n",
    "   By default, all attributes and methods in Python are public, meaning they can be accessed and modified directly from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Public attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Public attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "p = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "print(p.name)   # Accessing public attribute\n",
    "p.greet()       # Calling public method\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Private Attributes and Methods (Name Mangling)\n",
    "   To prevent direct access to attributes and methods, Python uses name mangling. By prefixing an attribute or method with double underscores (`__`), Python changes the name of the attribute or method internally to make it less accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   While it is still possible to access private members using name mangling (i.e., using the mangled name), it is not recommended as it breaks encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name  # Private attribute (name mangling)\n",
    "        self.__age = age    # Private attribute (name mangling)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __increment_age(self):  # Private method (name mangling)\n",
    "        self.__age += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.__name} and I am {self.__age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def have_birthday(self):\n",
    "        self.__increment_age()  # Encapsulating internal logic\n",
    "        print(f\"Happy birthday, {self.__name}! You are now {self.__age} years old.\")\n",

    "p.greet()               # Works fine\n",
    "p.have_birthday()       # Internal logic is encapsulated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Protected Attributes and Methods (Single Underscore)\n",
    "   Python uses a single underscore (`_`) as a convention to indicate that an attribute or method is protected — meaning it is intended to be used within the class or by subclasses, but it is still technically accessible from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "\n",
    "    def _increment_age(self):  # Protected method (by convention)\n",
    "        self._age += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self._name} and I am {self._age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "p = Person(\"Jasmeet Singh Arora\", 25)\n",
    "p.greet()  # Works fine\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Using Properties for Getter and Setter Methods\n",
    "   To control access to private attributes, you can use **properties**. Properties allow you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, while still allowing you to control the logic for getting or setting the values. This is a more Pythonic way to enforce encapsulation and provide controlled access to object attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can use the `property()` function or the `@property` decorator to create getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",

    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

    "        self.__age = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",

    "#48) Can encapsulation be bypassed in Python? If so, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Yes, encapsulation can technically be bypassed in Python, but it is important to understand that Python’s approach to encapsulation is convention-based rather than enforced by the language. In other words, Python relies on naming conventions (such as the use of underscores) and mechanisms like name mangling to signal the intended level of access to class attributes or methods, but these mechanisms can be circumvented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main ways encapsulation can be bypassed in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Accessing Private Attributes (Name Mangling)\n",
    "   Python uses name mangling for private attributes and methods. If an attribute or method is prefixed with `__` (double underscores), Python internally renames it by adding the class name as a prefix. This is done to avoid accidental name clashes in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "           self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "           self.__age = age    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "       def greet(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.__name} and I am {self.__age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   Python mangles the names of the private attributes to make them harder to access directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   p = Person(\"Jasmeet Singh Arora\", 25)\n",
    "   # print(p.__name)   # AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'\n",
    "\n",
    "   # However, we can access the mangled names directly:\n",
    "   print(p._Person__name)  # Outputs: Jasmeet Singh Arora\n",
    "   print(p._Person__age)   # Outputs: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Even though the `__name` and `__age` attributes are private, they can still be accessed directly via their mangled names (`_Person__name` and `_Person__age`).\n",
    "   - This bypasses encapsulation because the private members are still accessible if you know their mangled names, even though this is generally considered bad practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Accessing Protected Attributes\n",
    "   In Python, protected attributes are defined with a single underscore (`_`). This is purely a convention that signals that these attributes should not be accessed directly from outside the class. However, unlike private attributes, protected attributes can still be accessed without restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self._name = name  # Protected attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "   a = Animal(\"Lion\")\n",
    "   print(a._name)  # Outputs: Lion (no error)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `_name` attribute is considered protected, meaning it is intended to be used by the class and its subclasses. \n",
    "   - However, since there is no enforcement of this convention in Python, other parts of the program (even outside the class) can access and modify protected attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Using `__dict__` for Direct Access\n",
    "   Every Python object has a special attribute called `__dict__`, which contains a dictionary of all the objects attributes and methods. This provides another way to bypass encapsulation and access both private and protected attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "           self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "           self.__age = age    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "   p = Person(\"Jasmeet Singh Arora\", 25)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Accessing private attributes via __dict__\n",
    "   print(p.__dict__)  # {'_Person__name': 'Jasmeet Singh Arora', '_Person__age': 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `__dict__` attribute allows access to all the attributes of an object, including private ones. \n",
    "   - In this example, even though the `__name` and `__age` attributes are private, they can still be accessed directly via `p.__dict__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Using `getattr()` and `setattr()` Functions\n",
    "   Python provides built-in functions like `getattr()` and `setattr()` that can be used to access and modify an objects attributes dynamically. These functions can be used to bypass encapsulation as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "           self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "           self.__age = age    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "   p = Person(\"Jasmeet Singh Arora\", 25)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Access private attribute using getattr\n",
    "   print(getattr(p, \"_Person__name\"))  # Outputs: Jasmeet Singh Arora\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Modify private attribute using setattr\n",
    "   setattr(p, \"_Person__name\", \"Jasmeet Singh\")\n",
    "   print(p._Person__name)  # Outputs: Jasmeet Singh\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Even though `__name` is private, `getattr()` and `setattr()` can be used to directly access or modify it, bypassing the intended encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Inheriting from the Class\n",
    "   In Python, there’s nothing preventing subclasses from accessing and modifying the private or protected attributes of a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "   class Person:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "           self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
    "           self.__age = age    # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Employee(Person):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name, age, salary):\n",
    "           super().__init__(name, age)\n",
    "           self.salary = salary\n",
    "           # Direct access to the private attribute (name mangling)\n",
    "           print(self._Person__name)  # Can access private attribute via name mangling\n",
    "\n",
    "   e = Employee(\"Jasmeet\", 25, 170000)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the example above, the `Employee` class is able to access the `__name` attribute of the `Person` class using name mangling, even though it is private in the parent class.\n"

    "#51) Why is encapsulation considered a pillar of object-oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Encapsulation is considered one of the fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it directly contributes to the core principles of OOP and brings several key benefits that are essential for building maintainable, secure, and modular software systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data Hiding\n",
    "Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world, exposing only the necessary methods to interact with it. This means the internal details (data and implementation) are protected from direct manipulation, and access to them is restricted through well-defined interfaces (getters and setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "  class BankAccount:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "          self.__balance = balance  # private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "      def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "          if amount > 0:\n",
    "              self.__balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "      def get_balance(self):\n",
    "          return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "By restricting direct access to the `__balance` attribute, encapsulation helps ensure that changes to the balance are only made through methods that enforce business rules (like ensuring that only positive deposits are allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Modularity and Separation of Concerns\n",
    "Encapsulation allows you to divide your program into distinct modules, where each class is responsible for its own behavior and state. This makes it easier to manage complex systems because each class can be designed, tested, and maintained independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, model):\n",
    "        self.__engine_running = False\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        self.__engine_running = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_engine(self):\n",
    "        self.__engine_running = False\n",
    "\n",
    "By keeping the internal details of how the engine operates private, the `Car` class can be used without the user needing to know the intricate details of engine operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Maintaining Control and Validation\n",
    "Encapsulation allows you to control how data is accessed and modified. By using getter and setter methods, you can add validation, business logic, and constraints, ensuring that the object’s state remains consistent and valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",

    "\n",
    "Without encapsulation, external code could directly manipulate the balance, leading to inconsistencies or invalid states. Encapsulation enforces that the data can only be modified in appropriate ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Abstraction and Simplification\n",
    "Encapsulation allows you to provide a simplified interface to interact with an object while hiding the complex implementation details. This makes your code easier to use, understand, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example-\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "        self.__email = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_email(self, email):\n",
    "        if \"@\" in email:\n",
    "            self.__email = email\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid email format!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_email(self):\n",
    "        return self.__email\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the email validation logic is hidden within the `set_email()` method. External code interacts with the `Person` object through this method, abstracting away the complexity of email validation and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Flexibility and Maintainability\n",
    "Encapsulation increases the flexibility and maintainability of a system. Since the internal details are hidden, you can change the implementation of a class without affecting code that depends on it, as long as the public interface remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example- If you later want to change the way emails are validated or stored (e.g., moving from a simple string to an email object with more complex validation), you can make this change inside the `Person` class without affecting any code that uses the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Security and Integrity\n",
    "By restricting access to an objects internal state and only exposing controlled methods to interact with it, encapsulation helps protect the integrity of the objects data and ensures that it cannot be tampered with in unintended ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example- If you allow direct access to sensitive information (e.g., an employee’s salary), it could be manipulated or read by unauthorized entities. By making such data private and exposing only controlled methods, you can ensure that only authorized actions (such as a payroll system updating the salary) can affect sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Encapsulation and Object State Integrity\n",
    "Encapsulation helps preserve the integrity of an object by ensuring that its internal state is modified only in valid ways, through controlled interfaces (methods). This is particularly important when dealing with complex objects where the state must follow certain rules or invariants.\n"

    "#71) How does encapsulation relate to property decorators in Python? Provide an example showcasing encapsulation using property decorators?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), and it refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (a class), and restricting direct access to some of the classs components. This is done to protect the integrity of the objects data and prevent outside code from directly modifying the internal state in unexpected or invalid ways.\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is often achieved through private and protected attributes (indicated by a leading underscore `_`), and more commonly through getter, setter, and deleter methods (often decorated with `@property`, `@<property>.setter`, and `@<property>.deleter`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Property Decorators and Encapsulation-\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@property` decorator in Python allows for **encapsulation** by enabling you to manage how an attribute is accessed and modified. Using property decorators, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Restrict access to an attribute by providing a controlled getter or setter method.\n",
    "2. Add logic or validation to the getter/setter methods to ensure that the data is always valid.\n",
    "3. Keep the internal representation of an attribute hidden, so that external code can only interact with the object through its public interface (i.e., getter/setter methods).\n",
